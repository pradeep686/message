Working Directory: This is where your files are initially located. Files here are not yet tracked by Git.
Staging Area (Index): Files that youâ€™ve staged using git add are placed here. This is where Git prepares files for committing.
Local Repository: After running git commit, files are stored in the local Git repository. This is the history of commits in your .git folder.
Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub): When you run git push, your changes are sent to a remote repository to sync with a cloud service or a shared project.
